# PotatoDiseaseClassifier-DeepLearning-CNN

Farmers who grow potatoes suffer from serious financial standpoint losses each year which cause several diseases that affect potato plants. The diseases Early Blight and Late Blight are the most frequent. Early blight is caused by fungus and late blight is caused by specific micro-organisms and if farmers detect this disease early and apply appropriate treatment then it can save a lot of waste and prevent economical loss. The treatments for early blight and late blight are a little different so itâ€™s important that you accurately identify what kind of disease is there in that potato plant.

Here I will be creating a simple Image Classification Model that will categorize Potato Leaf Disease using a simple and classic Convolutional Neural Network Architecture

* The dataset has been taken from kaggle which consists of 1000 images of both early blight and late blight classes and also some images of healthy plant leafs

> Steps involved in building the model
* *Importing and preprocessing the data*
* *Performing data augmentation*
* *Building a convolution neural network model*
* *Training the model on the augmented data*
* *Evaluating model performance*
